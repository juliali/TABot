Story
INSPIRATION
As a parent of a primary school student, I was added into a few wechat groups to be informed from my child's teachers. I found that parents also need to ask some regular questions such as: when should I take my child today? which training class is after school today? Are there any notifications from teachers today? etc.

These questions annoy teachers, but they also cannot be ignored. How should we set up a chat bot to help teachers deal with them? That's the origin of this project. 

Besides asking schedule or notifications, the teacher assistant can also provide some examinations (math or English) to students. Those will be supplementary of regular homework. 

HOW IT WILL WORK / HOW IT WILL BE BUILT
Open the solution with Visual Studio 2015 or later, and start the WechatBotFramework porject.

This bot will work as a wechat account. It could be added into wechat groups or communicate with users as a wechat contact directly. Users send messages to it or at it in groups, and the bot generates responses and send back to users.
